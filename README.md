This software can be used to do approximately all the manual functions in a cinema theatre and helps to avoid the boring manual paperworks and makes the system work more smoothly and easily.

This software has two sides, one for the administrator/owner and the other for the ticket operator/worker.

These two parts were integrated within a single software. 

The database is kept at the administrators system.

These two systems are connected either with a lan cable or a wireless network.

The system can used to book tickets, cancel bookings, manage reservations, assign shows, prices, add movies, generate and view reports such as daily reports, monthly, weekly or reports for a specific period.
